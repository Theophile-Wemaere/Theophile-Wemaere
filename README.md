### About Me

Hi, I'm Th√©ophile Wemaere üëã

I am a french engineering student in computer science, passionate about cybersecurity, electronics and computers.

This account contains codes and resources for differents projets (schools and personals), feel free to browse and use anything here.

Most of the repositories are public except codes I made as an electronic consultants for [Junior ISEP](https://www.juniorisep.com/) or anything related to HackTheBox courses and exams.

In the futur I will add other projects I made regarding hardware security such as TPM sniffing, customs PCBs I made, and more !
